# Comfy Custom Node How-To
An unofficial, practical, collaborative Q&A to getting started developing custom nodes for ComfyUI

*Unofficial* - this guide isn't from the author(s) of ComfyUI. 

*Practical* - the guide favours the practical over the formal or comprehensive.

*Collaborative* - I'm kicking it off, but if others don't join in the effort I'll probably give up!

*Q&A* - The form is (at least to start with) expected to be vaguely question and answer-like, using github issues to track open questions.

## How to collaborate

**Ask a question** How do I do X in a custom node? Post it as an [issue](https://github.com/chrisgoringe/Comfy-Custom-Node-How-To/issues).

**Answer a question** Edit the [answer list](./answer-list.md) and make pull request for me to merge it in. If it's a really short answer (like "yes", or a URL, or anything shorter than a paragraph or so) just add it directly in the answer list under the question, but if it's longer, has code examples, images etc, then add a page in the answers directory, write a single sentence in the answer list, and link to the page.

**Write reference pages** Not everything has to be Q&A. Want to write a list of good custom nodes to look at when you're learning? Or a page of links to other sources? Go for it. Figure out a good place to put them.

**Check things** I'm not a ComfyUI expert, and I'm not likely to check everything anyone writes. So feel free to look for errors and PR them.

**Make this look better** I don't really know markdown very well. If you do, show us how to make this look better and easier to read.

**Organise stuff** If this works, it might get messy. If you're the type who likes to organise, feel free to sort things into themes and stuff.

**Help us make this happen** Want to set up a discord server or something where we can chat about this stuff?
